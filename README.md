<<<<<<< HEAD
In the stillness of the night,
When the stars twinkle bright,
A gentle breeze whispers by,
And the world seems to sigh.

This is amazing.

The moon casts its silver light,
And all is peaceful, calm, and right,

As nature sings its soothing song,
And carries our worries far along.

RIBOULET FLEHO

Quelqu’une des voix
Toujours angélique
– Il s’agit de moi, –
Vertement s’explique :


Ces mille questions
Qui se ramifient
N’amènent, au fond,
Qu’ivresse et folie ;


In the stillness of the night, When the stars twinkle bright, A gentle breeze whispers by, And the world seems to sigh.

The moon casts its silver light, And all is peaceful, calm, and right, As nature sings its soothing song, And carries our worries far along.
